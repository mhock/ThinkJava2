\chapter{Arrays and references}
\label{arrays}

Up to this point, the only variables we have used were for individual values such as numbers or strings.
In this chapter, we'll learn how to store multiple values of the same type using a single variable.
This language feature will enable you to write programs that manipulate larger amounts of data.

\section{Creating arrays}

\index{array}
\index{element}

An {\bf array} is a sequence of values; the values in the array are called {\bf elements}.
You can make an array of \java{int}s, \java{double}s, \java{String}s, or any other type, but all the values in an array must have the same type.

\index{type!array}
\index{[ ] square brackets}
\index{brackets!square}

To create an array, you have to declare a variable with an {\em array type} and then create the array itself.
Array types look like other Java types, except they are followed by square brackets (\java{[]}).
For example, the following lines declare that \java{counts} is an ``integer array'' and \java{values} is a ``double array'':

\begin{code}
int[] counts;
double[] values;
\end{code}

\index{new}
\index{operator!new}
\index{allocate}

To create the array itself, you have to use the \java{new} operator, which we first saw in Section~\ref{scanner}.
The \java{new} operator {\bf allocates} memory for the array and automatically initializes all of its elements to zero.

\begin{code}
counts = new int[4];
values = new double[size];
\end{code}

The first assignment makes \java{counts} refer to an array of four integers.
The second makes \java{values} refer to an array of \java{double}s, but the number of elements depends on the value of \java{size} (at the time the array is created).

Of course, you can also declare the variable and create the array with a single line of code:

\begin{code}
int[] counts = new int[4];
double[] values = new double[size];
\end{code}

\index{NegativeArraySizeException}
\index{exception!NegativeArraySize}

You can use any integer expression for the size of an array, as long as the value is nonnegative.
If you try to create an array with \java{-4} elements, for example, you will get a \java{NegativeArraySizeException}.
An array with zero elements is allowed, and there are special uses for such arrays that we'll see later on.


\section{Accessing elements}
\label{elements}

When you create an array with the \java{new} operator, the elements are initialized to zero.
Figure~\ref{fig.array} shows a memory diagram of the \java{counts} array so far.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figs/array.pdf}
\caption{Memory diagram of an \java{int} array.}
\label{fig.array}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\index{reference}

The arrow indicates that the value of \java{counts} is a {\bf reference} to the array.
You should think of {\em the array} and {\em the variable} that refers to it as two different things.
As we'll soon see, we can assign a different variable to refer to the same array, and we can change the value of \java{counts} to refer to a different array.

\index{element}
\index{index}
\index{array!element}
\index{array!index}

The large numbers inside the boxes are the elements of the array.
The small numbers outside the boxes are the {\bf indexes} used to identify each location in the array.
As with strings, the index of the first element is 0, not 1.
For this reason, we sometimes refer to the first element as the ``zeroth'' element.

The \java{[]} operator selects elements from an array:

\begin{code}
System.out.println("The zeroth element is " + counts[0]);
\end{code}

You can use the \java{[]} operator anywhere in an expression to access or modify the contents of the array:

\begin{code}
counts[0] = 7;
counts[1] = counts[0] * 2;
counts[2]++;
counts[3] -= 60;
\end{code}

Figure~\ref{fig.array2} shows the result of these statements.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{figs/array2.pdf}
\caption{Memory diagram after several assignment statements.}
\label{fig.array2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

You can use any expression as an index, as long as it has type \java{int}.
One of the most common ways to index an array is with a loop variable.
For example:

\begin{code}
int i = 0;
while (i < 4) {
    System.out.println(counts[i]);
    i++;
}
\end{code}

This \java{while} loop counts up from 0 to 4.
When \java{i} is 4, the condition fails and the loop terminates.
So the body of the loop is only executed when \java{i} is 0, 1, 2, and 3.
In this context, the variable name \java{i} is short for ``index''.

\index{loop variable}
\index{variable!loop}

Each time through the loop we use \java{i} as an index into the array, displaying the \java{i}th element.
This type of array processing is usually written as a \java{for} loop.

\begin{code}
for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    System.out.println(counts[i]);
}
\end{code}

\index{ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException}
\index{exception!ArrayIndexOutOfBounds}

For the \java{counts} array, the only legal indexes are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
If the index is negative or greater than 3, the result is an \java{ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException}.


\section{Displaying arrays}
\label{printarray}

\index{array!printing}

You can use \java{println} to display an array, but it probably doesn't do what you would like.
For example, the following fragment (1) declares an array variable, (2) makes it refer to an array of four elements, and (3) attempts to display the contents of the array using \java{println}:

\begin{code}
int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4};
System.out.println(a);
\end{code}

Unfortunately, the output is something like:

\begin{stdout}
[I@bf3f7e0
\end{stdout}

The bracket indicates that the value is an array, \java{I} stands for ``integer'', and the rest represents the address of the array in memory.
If we want to display the elements of the array, we could do it ourselves:

\begin{code}
public static void printArray(int[] a) {
    System.out.print("{" + a[0]);
    for (int i = 1; i < a.length; i++) {
        System.out.print(", " + a[i]);
    }
    System.out.println("}");
}
\end{code}

Given the previous array, the output of \java{printArray} is:

\begin{stdout}
{1, 2, 3, 4}
\end{stdout}

\index{utility class}
\index{Arrays class}

The Java library provides a utility class \java{java.util.Arrays} that has methods for working with arrays.
One of them, \java{toString}, returns a string representation of an array.
We can invoke it like this:

\begin{code}
System.out.println(Arrays.toString(a));
\end{code}

And the output is:

\begin{stdout}
[1, 2, 3, 4]
\end{stdout}

As usual, we have to \java{import java.util.Arrays} before we can use it.
Notice that the string format is slightly different: it uses square brackets instead of curly braces.
But it beats having to write your own \java{printArray} method.


\section{Copying arrays}

\index{array!copying}

As explained in Section~\ref{elements}, array variables contain {\em references} to arrays.
When you make an assignment to an array variable, it simply copies the reference.
But it doesn't copy the array itself.
For example:

\begin{code}
double[] a = new double[3];
double[] b = a;
\end{code}

These statements create an array of three \java{double}s and make two different variables refer to it, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig.array3}.

\index{memory diagram}
\index{diagram!memory}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figs/array3.pdf}
\caption{Memory diagram of two variables referring to the same array.}
\label{fig.array3}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\index{alias}

Any changes made through either variable will be seen by the other.
For example, if we set \java{a[0] = 17.0}, and then display \java{b[0]}, the result is {\tt 17.0}.
Because \java{a} and \java{b} are different names for the same thing, they are sometimes called {\bf aliases}.

If you actually want to copy the array, not just the reference, you have to create a new array and copy the elements from one to the other, like this:

\begin{code}
double[] b = new double[3];
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    b[i] = a[i];
}
\end{code}

\index{Arrays class}

\java{java.util.Arrays} provides a method named \java{copyOf} that performs this task for you.
So you can replace the previous code with one line:

\begin{code}
double[] b = Arrays.copyOf(a, 3);
\end{code}

The second parameter is the number of elements you want to copy, so \java{copyOf} can also be used to copy part of an array.
Figure~\ref{fig.array4} shows the state of the array variables after invoking \java{Arrays.copyOf}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{figs/array4.pdf}
\caption{Memory diagram of two variables referring to different arrays.}
\label{fig.array4}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


%\section{Array length}

\index{length!array}
\index{array!length}

The examples so far only work if the array has three elements.
It is better to generalize the code to work with arrays of any size.
We can do that by replacing the magic number, \java{3}, with \java{a.length}:

\begin{code}
double[] b = new double[a.length];
for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    b[i] = a[i];
}
\end{code}

All arrays have a built-in constant, \java{length}, that stores the number of elements.
In contrast to \java{String.length()}, which is a method, \java{a.length} is a constant.
The expression \java{a.length} may look like a method invocation, but there are no parentheses and no arguments.

The last time the loop gets executed, \java{i} is \java{a.length - 1}, which is the index of the last element.
When \java{i} is equal to \java{a.length}, the condition fails and the body is not executed -- which is a good thing, because trying to access \java{a[a.length]} would throw an exception.

Of course we can replace the loop altogether by using \java{Arrays.copyOf} and \java{a.length} for the second argument.
The following line produces the same result shown in Figure~\ref{fig.array4}.

\begin{code}
double[] b = Arrays.copyOf(a, a.length);
\end{code}


\section{Array traversal}
\label{traversal}

\index{traversal}

Many computations can be implemented by looping through the elements of an array and performing an operation on each element.
Looping through the elements of an array is called a {\bf traversal}.

\begin{code}
int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
    a[i] *= a[i];
}
\end{code}

This example traverses an array and squares each element.
At the end of the loop, the array has the values \java{\{1, 4, 9, 16, 25\}}.

\index{search}


Another common pattern is a {\bf search}, which involves traversing an array and ``searching'' for a particular element.
For example, the following method takes an array and a value, and it returns the index where the value appears:

\begin{code}
public static int search(double[] array, double target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] == target) {
            return i;
        }
    }
    return -1;  // not found
}
\end{code}

If we find the target value in the array, we return its index immediately.
If the loop exits without finding the target, it returns \java{-1}, a special value chosen to indicate a failed search.
(This code is essentially what the \java{String.indexOf} method does.)

The following code searches an array for the value \java{1.23}, which is the third element.
Because array indexes start at zero, the output is \java{2}.

\begin{code}
double[] array = {3.14, -55.0, 1.23, -0.8};
int index = search(array, 1.23);
System.out.println(index);
\end{code}


\index{reduce}

Another common traversal is a {\bf reduce} operation, which ``reduces'' an array of values down to a single value.
Examples include the sum or product of the elements, the minimum, and the maximum.
The following method takes an array and returns the sum of its elements:

\begin{code}
public static double sum(double[] array) {
    double total = 0.0;
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        total += array[i];
    }
    return total;
}
\end{code}

\index{accumulator}

Before the loop, we initialize \java{total} to zero.
Each time through the loop, we update \java{total} by adding one element from the array.
At the end of the loop, \java{total} contains the sum of the elements.
A variable used this way is sometimes called an {\bf accumulator}, because it ``accumulates'' the running total.


\section{Random numbers}
\label{random}

\index{deterministic}

Most computer programs do the same thing every time they run; programs like that are called {\bf deterministic}.
Usually determinism is a good thing, since we expect the same calculation to yield the same result.
But for some applications, we want the computer to be unpredictable.
Games are an obvious example, but there are many others, like scientific simulations.

%Technically speaking, all computer programs are deterministic: they simply execute the source code.

\index{nondeterministic}
\index{pseudorandom}

Making a program {\bf nondeterministic} turns out to be hard, because it's impossible for a computer to generate truly random numbers.
But there are algorithms that generate unpredictable sequences called {\bf pseudorandom} numbers.
For most applications, they are as good as random.

%Nondeterminism is a theoretical concept for analyzing the complexity of algorithms.

\index{Random}
\index{nextInt!Random}

If you did Exercise~\ref{guess}, you have already seen \java{java.util.Random}, which generates pseudorandom numbers.
The method \java{nextInt} takes an integer argument, \java{n}, and returns a random integer between \java{0} and \java{n - 1} (inclusive).

If you generate a long series of random numbers, every value should appear, at least approximately, the same number of times.
One way to test this behavior of \java{nextInt} is to generate a large number of values, store them in an array, and count the number of times each value occurs.

The following method creates an \java{int} array and fills it with random numbers between 0 and 99.
The argument specifies the desired size of the array, and the return value is a reference to the new array.

\begin{code}
public static int[] randomArray(int size) {
    Random random = new Random();
    int[] a = new int[size];
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        a[i] = random.nextInt(100);
    }
    return a;
}
\end{code}

The following \java{main} method generates an array and displays it using \java{printArray} from Section~\ref{printarray}.
We could have used \java{Arrays.toString}, but we like seeing curly braces instead of square brackets.

\begin{code}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    int[] array = randomArray(8);
    printArray(array);
}
\end{code}

Each time you run the program, you should get different values.
The output will look something like this:

\begin{stdout}
{15, 62, 46, 74, 67, 52, 51, 10}
\end{stdout}


\section{Building a histogram}
\label{singlepass}

\index{histogram}
\index{counter}

If these values were exam scores -- and they would be pretty bad exam scores in that case -- the teacher might present them to the class in the form of a {\bf histogram}.
In statistics, a histogram is a set of counters that keeps track of the number of times each value appears.

For exam scores, we might have ten counters to keep track of how many students scored in the 90s, the 80s, etc.
To do that, we can traverse the array and count the number of elements that fall in a given range.

The following method takes an array and two integers.
It returns the number of elements that fall in the range from \java{low} to \java{high - 1}.

\begin{code}
public static int inRange(int[] a, int low, int high) {
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] >= low && a[i] < high) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
\end{code}

\index{reduce}

This pattern should look familiar: it is another reduce operation.
Notice that \java{low} is included in the range (\java{>=}), but \java{high} is excluded (\java{<}).
This design keeps us from counting any scores twice.

Now we can count the number of scores in each grade range.
We add the following code to our \java{main} method:

\begin{code}
int[] scores = randomArray(30);
int a = inRange(scores, 90, 100);
int b = inRange(scores, 80, 90);
int c = inRange(scores, 70, 80);
int d = inRange(scores, 60, 70);
int f = inRange(scores, 0, 60);
\end{code}

This code is repetitive, but it is acceptable as long as the number of ranges is small.
Suppose we wanted to keep track of the number of times each individual score appears.
Then we would have to write 100 lines of code:

\begin{code}
int count0 = inRange(scores, 0, 1);
int count1 = inRange(scores, 1, 2);
int count2 = inRange(scores, 2, 3);
...
int count99 = inRange(scores, 99, 100);
\end{code}

What we need is a way to store 100 counters, preferably so we can use an index to access them.
Wait a minute, that's exactly what an array does.

The following fragment creates an array of 100 counters, one for each possible score.
It loops through the scores and uses \java{inRange} to count how many times each score appears.
Then it stores the results in the \java{counts} array:

\begin{code}
int[] counts = new int[100];
for (int i = 0; i < counts.length; i++) {
    counts[i] = inRange(scores, i, i + 1);
}
\end{code}

Notice that we are using the loop variable \java{i} three times: as an index into the \java{counts} array, and in the last two arguments of \java{inRange}.

\index{efficiency}

The code works, but it is not as efficient as it could be.
Every time the loop invokes \java{inRange}, it traverses the entire array.
It would be better to make a single pass through the \java{scores} array.

For each score, we already know which range it falls in -- the score itself.
We can use that value to increment the corresponding counter.
This code traverses the array of scores {\em only once} to generate the histogram:

\begin{code}
int[] counts = new int[100];
for (int i = 0; i < scores.length; i++) {
    int index = scores[i];
    counts[index]++;
}
\end{code}

Each time through the loop, it selects one element from \java{scores} and uses it as an index to increment the corresponding element of \java{counts}.
Because this code traverses the array of scores only once, it is much more efficient.


\section{The enhanced for loop}
\label{enhanced}

Since traversing arrays is so common, Java provides an alternative syntax that makes the code more compact.
Consider a \java{for} loop that displays the elements of an array on separate lines:

\begin{code}
for (int i = 0; i < values.length; i++) {
    int value = values[i];
    System.out.println(value);
}
\end{code}

We could rewrite the loop like this:

\begin{code}
for (int value : values) {
    System.out.println(value);
}
\end{code}

\index{enhanced for loop}
\index{for!enhanced}

This statement is called an {\bf enhanced for loop}, also known as the ``for each'' loop.
You can read the code as, ``for each \java{value} in \java{values}''.
It's conventional to use plural nouns for array variables and singular nouns for element variables.

Notice how the single line \java{for (int value : values)} replaces the first two lines of the standard \java{for} loop.
It hides the details of iterating each index of the array, and instead, focuses on the values themselves.

Using the enhanced \java{for} loop, and removing the temporary variable, we can write the histogram code from the previous section more concisely:

\begin{code}
int[] counts = new int[100];
for (int score : scores) {
    counts[score]++;
}
\end{code}

Enhanced \java{for} loops often make the code more readable, especially for accumulating values.
But they are not helpful when you need to refer to the index, as in search operations.

\begin{code}
for (double d : array) {
    if (d == target) {
        // array contains d, but we don't know where
    }
}
\end{code}
